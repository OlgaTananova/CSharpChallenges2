# Parking System Simulation in C#
A simple object-oriented parking lot simulation developed in C# as a practice project.

## Features
- Supports multiple vehicle types: Car, Motorcycle, Truck
- Truck requires two adjacent parking spots
- Park and remove vehicles
- Track available parking spots in real time
- Includes unit tests using xUnit

## Concepts Covered
- Object-oriented principles: abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation
- Separation of concerns between core components: Vehicle, ParkingSpot, ParkingLot
- Basic simulation of real-world parking constraints
- Test-driven development practices

## Tech Stack
- C# (.NET)
- Unit for unit testing

## Future improvements
- Levels/multiple floors 
- Billing support
